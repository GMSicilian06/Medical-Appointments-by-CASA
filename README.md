# Medical-Appointments-by-CASA

My project is a Website that shows everything that my mother's medical clinic offers to the public. It offers a friendly interface made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to the public, so the content and services are well-presented. It has two HTMLs(which are divided into a navbar and then various sections). 

The first HTML shows all the services the clinic offers, with a little comments sections, where people can add their comments; the comments are stored on a sqlite database for future purposes of improvements, paying close attention to our clients ideas, these comments later are presented in a "Recent comments section". 

The second HTML is intended to work as a form that stores the appointments day, time, names and description in a database. This is also automated to save all new appointments on the database on a csv file.
The whole project uses Flask for backend purposes.
